# Scrabble.py
This is a python package encoding the game logic for Scrabble. APIs also indicate when moves are invalid (against the rules) to enable error detection in game data capture.

## TODO (in order of priority):
- Add functionality to `Board` to detect all words formed by a move (for challenges)
  - Possible to combine similar logic with move scoring?
- Add more unit tests for scoring
